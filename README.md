# Fractal-Tree

Fractal tree demo in HTML5 and JS

# TODO

## Must

- Draw dashed border around selected tree and possibly make other trees less bold
  - Need to have a way to clear the selection so it looks normal
- Style number inputs

## Should

- Rotation
  - Adjustments after rotation are still relative to the default starting position
- Make styles cross browser compatible
- Split classes up into files and make them self contained

# Could

- Animation
- Multiselect
- Make responsive

# BUGS

- When position point is outside the range (above the height limit) user cannot select it anymore
